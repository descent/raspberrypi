See the top level README file for more information on documentation
and how to run these programs.

Derived from uart05

This is specific to the Raspberry Pi 2 as it experiments with the
multiple processor cores.

So thanks to JS2 in the raspberry pi bare metal forum for the info

Not sure where or if this is really documented.  But if you write to
address

0x4000009C for core 1
0x400000AC for core 2
0x400000BC for core 3

With the address to the entry point for the code you want that core
to run...it will start that core.

This program starts up the other three cores, lets them fight over the
memory location at address 0x40.  Core 0 reads 0x40 and prints out
when it sees it change.  It is going to look somewhat random.
